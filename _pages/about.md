I am an undergraduate student pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science at University of California - Berkeley. I am interested in systems, image manipulation, and machine learning research. I am also an undergrad researcher in RISELab where I work under Prof. Randy Katz on serverless machine learning frameworks. Outside of research I teach classes on discrete math, probability theory, and machine learning.
